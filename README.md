# MY WEBSITE

Here is my personal website in development written using my own framework and tooling.
To chech the framework behind all this go to [Innerscope](https://github.com/oarabilekoore/innerscope.ts)

To get started, clone the repository and run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/oarabilekoore/oarabile-koore.git
cd oarabile-koore
bun install
bun run dev
```

Here is an up-to-date screenshot of the website.
